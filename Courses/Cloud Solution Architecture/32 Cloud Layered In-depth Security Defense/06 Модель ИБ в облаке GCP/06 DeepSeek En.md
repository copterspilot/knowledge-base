# **Defense in Depth Network Security in Google Cloud: Comprehensive Implementation Guide**

## **1. Micro-segment Access to Applications and Services**

### **IAM (API-based Access)**
**Purpose:** Granular access control to GCP resources  
**Requirements:**
- Implement principle of least privilege (PoLP)
- Use predefined roles over custom roles when possible
- Enable organization policy constraints
- Enforce multi-factor authentication for admin accounts

**Recommendations:**
- Use IAM Conditions for context-aware access
- Implement service account impersonation instead of key sharing
- Enable audit logging for all critical resources

**Violation Example:**  
*Case (2021):* A developer assigned `roles/editor` to a CI/CD service account which was later compromised.  
*Impact:* Attacker gained write access to all resources in the project, deployed crypto-mining software.  
*Lessons:* Should have used `roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor` with restricted permissions.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] No users have primitive roles (owner/editor/viewer) at org/folder level
- [ ] Service accounts have minimum required permissions
- [ ] IAM Conditions used for time/IP-based restrictions
- [ ] Audit logs enabled for all admin activities

### **Istio Security (Micro-segmentation based on HTTP/S)**

**Requirements:**
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) for all service communications
- Default-deny Authorization Policies
- Workload identity verification

**Recommendations:**
- Enforce STRICT mTLS mode
- Implement namespace isolation
- Use JWT claims for fine-grained access

**Violation Example:**  
*Case (2022):* Missing AuthorizationPolicy allowed lateral movement from compromised frontend to database pods.  
*Impact:* 450K customer records exfiltrated.  
*Lessons:* Should have implemented `DENY all` default policy with explicit ALLOW rules.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] mTLS in STRICT mode cluster-wide
- [ ] Default DENY AuthorizationPolicy in place
- [ ] Regular scanning for misconfigured policies

### **Firewalls per Service Account**

**Recommendations:**
- Replace IP-based rules with identity-based
- Implement hierarchical firewall policies
- Use tags for additional grouping

**Violation Example:**  
*Case (2020):* Overly permissive rule (`0.0.0.0/0:22`) allowed SSH brute force attacks.  
*Impact:* Compromised VMs used in DDoS botnet.  
*Lessons:* Should have used IAP for SSH and service account-based rules.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] No rules allowing `0.0.0.0/0` except for HTTP(S)

**Violation Example:**  
*Case (2021):* Missing network policies allowed crypto-mining malware to spread across pods.  
*Impact:* $85K in compute costs before detection.  
*Lessons:* Should have implemented default-deny with explicit ALLOW policies.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Network Policy enabled on GKE clusters
- [ ] Default-deny policy implemented

**Violation Example:**  
*Case (2022):* Missing perimeter allowed data copy from private GCS to public bucket.  
*Impact:* 2TB of sensitive data exposed.  
*Lessons:* Should have implemented VPC SC with proper access levels.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Service perimeters defined for sensitive projects
- [ ] No resources bypassing perimeters
